## General features

- Displays vertex and edge count
- Showing/hiding vertex labels
- Customizable edge color
- Configurable amount of rendered edges
- Manual vertex dragging (dragging vertex during layout makes its community follow it)

## Layout

### ForceAtlas 2
- Max UI updates per second â€” the tradeoff between layout speed and smoothness 
  (set a lower value for faster layout and a higher value for smoother video)
- Iterations per second â€” the number of algorithm iterations completed in the last second
- Tolerance â€” speed-accuracy tradeoff 
  (set a higher value to make vertices move faster and a lower value to make them oscillate less)
- Scaling â€” resulting layout size (a higher value results in a larger layout)
- Strong gravity â€” when turned on makes gravity force attract distant vertices more, resulting in a more compact layout
- Gravity â€” force preventing disconnected components from drifting away
- Prevent overlap â€” when turned on drastically repulses overlapping and nearly overlapping vertices 
  (slows down layout process, it's recommended to turn on this option when the layout is almost completed)
- Dissuade hubs â€” when turned on grants vertices with a high indegree a more central position
- Attraction types:
  * Linear â€” default attraction type
  * Logarithmic â€” makes clusters tighter but converges slower in some cases
- Edge weight exponent â€” influence of edge weights on a layout
- Multithreaded â€” when turned on, some computations are performed in parallel
- Barnes-Hut approximation â€” when turned on considerably improves performance by approximating repulsion force
- Barnes-Hut theta â€” acceptable repulsion approximation 
  (higher theta improves performance but results in unnatural vertex formations)

### Random layout
- Max coordinate deviation â€” resulting layout size

## Community detection

### Louvain method
- Pause between iterations â€” when turned on makes the algorithm pause after each iteration, letting the user examine intermediate results

## Serialization formats

### SQLite

Vertices are stored in the `Vertices` table with the following columns:
- `id` â€” unique textual identifier of the vertex
- `x` and `y` â€” vertex position
- `radius` â€” vertex radius
- `red`, `green`, and `blue` â€” vertex color

Edges are stored in the `Edges` table with the following columns:
- `from` â€” identifier of the edge head
- `to` â€” identifier of the edge weight
- `weight` â€” edge weight

### Neo4j

Vertices are represented as Neo4j nodes with the following properties:
- `id` â€” unique textual identifier of the vertex
- `x` and `y` â€” vertex position
- `radius` â€” vertex radius
- `red`, `green`, and `blue` â€” vertex color

Edges are represented as Neo4j relationships between corresponding nodes and have the following property:
- `weight` â€” edge weight

## Roadmap

* Add example graphs
* Support opening non-analyzed graphs
* Store colors for communities and not for individual vertices
* Support CSV serialization format
* Implement centrality algorithm
  
## Build and execution

To build or run this project, you must use JDK 8 with JavaFX (`jfxrt.jar`) package installed. 
See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for more details.

Build: `./gradlew assemble`  
Run: `./gradlew run`  
Run tests: `./gradlew test`  
Run tests in headless mode (without UI): `./gradlew test -Pheadless=true`

## Troubleshooting

```
ðŸ‘» java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javafx/application/Application
```
```
ðŸ‘» Supertypes of the following classes cannot be resolved. Please make sure you have the required dependencies in the classpath:
      class tornadofx.UIComponent, unresolved supertypes: javafx.event.EventTarget
      class tornadofx.App, unresolved supertypes: javafx.application.Application
      class org.controlsfx.control.ControlsFXControl, unresolved supertypes: javafx.scene.control.Control
      class tornadofx.FXTask, unresolved supertypes: javafx.concurrent.Task
      class tornadofx.Fieldset, unresolved supertypes: javafx.scene.layout.VBox
```
ðŸ’¡ You are using JDK distribution without JavaFX (`jfxrt.jar`) package.

âœ… Install JDK distribution that includes JavaFX by default (e.g. [Oracle JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)), update `JAVA_HOME` system variable, and restart your computer.
## Technologies

**UI:** JavaFX, TornadoFX, ControlsFX
